```

# Problem 1
## Import Instacart
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets) # Already installed datasets for the homework
data("instacart")
ncol(instacart)
nrow(instacart)
head(instacart)
```

## EDA
```{r}
instacart%>%
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
